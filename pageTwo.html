			<br>
			<br>
			        I was employed by Blackhawk Industrial in Brunswick, Ohio. My position of warehouse lead consisted
				 of receiving all incoming product paperwork into the P21 system via hand held scanner and keyboard.
				 I then generated the product pick tickets, which were used to process the product to it's next stage.
				 Some product required re-packaging for the customers Cribmaster machines. Cribmaster allows tooling
				 to be vaccuum packed on small cards, which are then inserted into the vending machine coils, allowing
				 the customer 24 hour access stock to high demand tooling, while only paying for the tooling used.
				     Other product was sent directly to shipping, while export product was forwarded to varios staging 
			     area's for future packaging and shipping. The remaining product was put in designated stock locations
				 or new locations were created.
				     I was also responsible for international shipping, and inventory control as well as daily/weekly cycle
					 counts. I also drove forklifts and used various other equipment, pallet jacks and banding equipment.
