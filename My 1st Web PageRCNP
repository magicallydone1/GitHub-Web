					Hello, and welcome to my web pressence.
				    I am currently a student in Cleveland Codes Software Development.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. I received my formal education through the Cleveland Public School 
				   System. In junior high school, I was very fortunate to be able to participate in an experimental education 
				   program which allowed our class to take advanced courses, normally reserved for high school and/or first year 
				   college students. The course's focused on math and science predominately including calculus and biology. A new 
				   addition was added to the school which housed the Biology class and lab. This was especially exciting for me 
				   since math and science were my two favorite subjects. In my first year of high school, I decided 
				   I wanted to play the bass guitar, so I worked part time after school and purchased my first Hagstrom 8 string bass.
				   I played locally in several bands through out high school, and our band received second place in a battle of the bands
				   sponsored by WMMS radio station.
				   The highlight of my musical career came when our band played for  mayoral candidate Kiley Cronin
				   outside his headquarters on Euclid Ave. Channel 8 tv filmed us briefly and later included a shot of our band playing
				   in a comercial called "Channel 8, We Live Here and We Like It", my 15 seconds of fame. I continued with my academic path
				   until my senior year, when an automotive repair facility was added to the school. My love for cars and racing led me 
				   to attend this class and upon graduating high school, I enrolled in an Automotive Technician course at the Denver 
				   Automotive and Diesel College. After graduation, I worked for a Cheverolet dealership where I achieved my 
				   Mr. Goodwrench certification. I purchased a 1969 Rally Sport Z-28 camaro, and rebuilt the stock 302CI into a radical 
				   street racer. After 17 years in Colorado, I returned to Cleveland, Ohio.
